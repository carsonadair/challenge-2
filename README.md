# challenge-2

In this challenge, I created my portfolio website. I provided a short summary of my work experience along with a picture of myself, and a portfolio section featuring a sampling of my work, and spaces to add more as my work grows. I also added a contact section with links to email, call, or access my github, and below that a form to reach out to me without leaving the website. 

The website is responsive to various devices, correcting the alignment and sizing for tablet sizes and smartphone sized screens. 

The buttons in the navigation bar will take the user to various areas of the website to access sections easily. There is also a button fixed to the bottom right of the screen to return the user to the top of the page and make navigation smoother. 

My deployed page is accessable here.
